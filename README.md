# Proveably Random Raffle Contracts

## What I want it to do

1. Users enter by buying tickets
    1. Users tickets form the price pool
2. Randomly select a winner automatically
   2. This should be done programmatically
   2. The winner should be selected after a set time elapses 
3. Using chainlink VRF for randomness
   and Chainlink Automation for time based trigger
